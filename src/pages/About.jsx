                I&#39;ve got a background in <span>financial engineering</span>, 
                but my focus has shifted to <span>full-stack development</span>. I&#39;m all about diving
                into projects where I can leverage my analytical skills to craft innovative web solutions.
                My journey into tech was driven by a desire to build scalable, user-centric applications 
                that could transform financial systems.

                I&#39;m always eager to collaborate on cutting-edge projects where I can blend my finance
                knowledge with full-stack development to solve real-world problems.
